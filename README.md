🌟 Unveiling Insights from Aviation Safety: Bird Strikes Analysis Dashboard 🦅✈️

🔍 Project Overview: I utilized a comprehensive dataset detailing incidents of bird strikes across various phases of flight, aircraft types, and geographical locations. This project involved creating interactive dashboards using Power BI to provide a thorough analysis of bird strike incidents from 2000 to 2011.

💡 Key Insights: Average Bird Strikes: 5,720 annually, with a significant peak in 2010. Financial Impact: The cost incurred due to bird strikes averaged $11.80 million per year, peaking at $23 million in 2001. Phase of Flight: The majority of strikes occur during the descent phase, with an average altitude of 5,934 feet. Top Species: European Starlings are the most frequently involved species, with 9,417 strikes, accounting for 48.45% of total incidents. Airports and Airlines: Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport reported the highest number of bird strikes, while Business and Southwest Airlines are notably impacted.

📈 Dashboard Features: Interactive Visualizations: Analyzing bird strikes by year, species, altitude, and flight phase. Geographic Mapping: Pinpointing strike incidents across the United States to identify hotspots. Cost Analysis: Evaluating the financial impact by year, aiding in resource allocation for preventive measures. Detailed Analytics: Understanding the effects on flight operations, such as engine shutdowns and precautionary landings.

👨‍💻 Technical Approach: Tools Used: Power BI for data visualization, DAX for complex calculations, and Excel for initial data cleaning. Data Modeling: Structured data to facilitate clear insights and actionable intelligence.

📊 Outcomes: This dashboard aims to support aviation authorities and airlines in identifying patterns, reducing bird strike incidents, and enhancing flight safety measures.

This project provided a valuable experience in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and visualization.
